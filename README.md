# Python Portfolio

This is my portfolio containing all Python portfolio projects assigned in Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). To enhance the portfolio and get in the habit of Test Driven Development, I have decided to implement unit tests using `pytest`.
